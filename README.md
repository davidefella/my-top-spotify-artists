Current version: 1.0.0

Live deploy: [https://my-top-spotify-artists.onrender.com/](https://my-top-spotify-artists.onrender.com/)

## Overview

"My Spotify Top 3 Artists" is a web application that allows users to view their top 3 most listened-to artists on Spotify during a specific period of time. After logging in and authorizing the application to access their Spotify account, the application automatically retrieves the necessary information to display the requested data. The resulting HTML page presents the information in a simple and intuitive way. 

Please note that this application was developed as part of a learning exercise and is not optimized for production use. There may be areas that can be improved or optimized for better performance and security.

## Authentication with Spotify

This project uses the Spotify Web API for retrieving data. To use this API, you need to authenticate with Spotify and obtain an access token.

The authentication method used in this project is the Client Credentials Flow. This flow is used when your application is accessing its own data (i.e., not on behalf of a user). It is used for server-to-server authentication.

To authenticate with the Spotify API, you will need to provide your Client ID and Client Secret, which can be obtained from the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/). Once you have obtained these credentials, you can make a request to the Spotify Web API to obtain an access token.

Please note that applications running in development mode in Spotify can only handle up to 25 users (excluding the developer), and if you want to allow others to test your application, you will need to manually add them as authorized users in the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).

For more information on the authentication flow, see the [Spotify Authorization Guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/).
